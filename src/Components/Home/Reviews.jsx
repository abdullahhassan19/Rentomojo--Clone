        "Marriage comes with a lot of unavoidable expenses in India and spending a big chunk of your savings on furniture and white goods, could be a big challenge. RentoMojo not just took away all our worries but in fact went to the extent of spoiling us. Where I could have owned just some bare essentials after making a huge hole in my pocket or paid unnecessary EMIs, I could smartly own a lot of stuff which would have come much later on my list. Heartfelt thanks to the whole Rentomojo team for making our rentingexperience completely hassle-free. It has been two great years and am sure there are many more to come.",

They delivered it within a day and set it up at my place without any hassle. Now I sleep so peacefully that I always end up being late for work :D",

Everything was garbled for me and huge tension of getting apartment, buying furnitures, selling while going back to Bangalore. Thanks to RentoMojo for excellent budgeted plans. With few mouse clicks and nominal security deposit u are done e. No tension for delivery, Rentomojo is a furniture wish wizard. Also takes care of relocation made my life easy. Happy to be a customer for Rentomojo. It made my house a happy home!",
